**AsdMonitor** is a simple interface to create a control chart for monitoring the quality of predictions from ASD spectra of check-cells.

The ASD files are imported using the R package *asdreader* (Roudier & LalibertÃ©, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/asdreader/index.html) available on CRAN. To be imported, the ASD files must have been generated from IndicoPro version >= V6.

### Guide

In the **Control chart** panel:

* Step 1: The user selects and loads his ASD files. The plot of the spectra is displayed in the Data panel.

* Step 2: The user selects and loads an Excel file (.xls or .xlsx) defining the prediction equation. The predictions are displayed in a control chart. 

The first sheet of the Excel file containing the equation has to be structured as follows:
